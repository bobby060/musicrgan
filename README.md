# musicrgan
As the name for this repo suggests, this was intended to be a recurrennt generative adversarial network that created music. As a quick exploration of this repo will also show, that is not what happened. As a result, this repo contains the code for three attempts at generating music, each with varying levels of success:

1. A Recurrent GAN
2. A Regressive model (my design)
3. A Regressive model (design from [here](https://github.com/unnati-xyz/music-generation))
